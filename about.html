    <h1>A Bit About Me!</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <b>The throughline of all my campus involvement is community building. From my very first day at University of Florida, I was searching for my passion and my people. I found my community first with the Pride Student Union, where I worked as the Internal Vice President and the Queer Cultivation Program. In this role, I was able to present to over 80+ members at 24 General Body Meetings. While in these positions, I started work with First Year Florida as a Peer Leader. As a Peer Leader, I delivered a college success course - building my connection with the first-year student community. Finally, as a part of Women in Computer Science, I have strived to support others in my field and create a welcoming environment for students regardless of their background.</b>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Background</h2>
    <b>I am from Coral Springs, Florida, outside of Ft. Lauderdale. I have 1 brother (my twin actually!). I have been at UF since 2022, and will graduate in Spring 2026. I am deeply involved with my queer community, and I love being able to reach out and connect with others with a shared identity.</b>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Special Interests & Hobbies</h2>

        <li>Reading - I love taking advantage of the library system and its audiobooks!</li>
        <li>Sports - I attend as many games as I can with my friends, while I have so many good teams available to see. The UF Men's Basketball Team just won a national championship and we all rejoiced!</li>
